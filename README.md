# What is Duxcore
Duxcore is the next generation of hosting solutions. We will offer many services and solutions to allow you to host just about anything you can think of for the cheapest possible price possible. As we continue our development, we will add support for many types of services and we will make it as easy and affordable to use these services! One of our biggest goals is to be able to provide as many free services as we can without compromising on quality, thus making quality our highest priority. As we continue to release updates and get things set up, we hope that you will be here for the ride because we have many cool things in store for this platform!

# How much will it cost and how will I pay?
As stated before, we want to be able to provide you with the most affordable hosting experience possible, so the prices you see will be as low as we can make them without compromising on quality. We will probably use a pay-as-you-go model so that you can simply deposit money into your account and you can pay for what you use instead of having to pay monthly for something that you only need to use twice a week. 

## Crypto Currencies
We plan to accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment, which works well with our pay-as-you-go system because this will allow you to simply deposit your cryptocurrency into your account and you will get what the cryptocurrency is worth when you deposited it. We will hopefully be able to accept a variety of different cryptocurrencies to make it easy for everybody to use cryptocurrency with our services.
