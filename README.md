# What is Duxcore

Duxcore is going to be a decentralized hosting provider, that will eventually be able to provide free services. It will not begin decentralized, but we will be implementing the infrastructure to add decentralization later. The moment we introduce the decentralized hosting scheme into Duxcore will be the moment we will be able to begin providing free services.

# What will I be able to have hosted?

We want to be able to host anything! We plan to set everything up to allow you to have just about any app or service hosted on our platform. We will start with a palette of the most commonly hosted services, and will swiftly increase the number of things we have the capacity to host. There will be no single category, or just a few specific products; we want to be able to host anything you need, as cheaply as possible. (or even for free)

# How much will it cost and how will I pay?

As it stands right now, we will have to charge for hosting in the beginning, as we will not be introducing the decentralized hosting scheme until a later date. That being said, we plan on charging you based on what you actually use, so you will not be paying per hour, nor per month, but rather for your actual usage of the service(s) you get. You will pay by pre-charging your account in fiat via credit or debit card, or in a cryptocurrency of your choice. We fully intend to offer cryptocurrencies as payment options for any and all paid plans, and we plan to accept many different cryptocurrencies.

# How will the decentralization work?

We will not be sharing this information until our plan is finalized. We will be discussing details on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/dTGJ5Bchnq), so be sure to join.
